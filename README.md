While there are other Screeps code bases which focus on automation, this is the
first codebase which has automated its own management and deployment. The Quorum
project does not have a single specific user behind it, but is completely
independent.

All Pull Requests are done by volunteers, and the entire project is
[open source](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/screeps-quorum/blob/master/LICENSE).

## How does it work?

* Anyone can make a pull request. Developers can then vote on the pull requests
  using reactions (:+1:, :-1:, or :confused:). Pull requests which meet the
  [consensus rules](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/screeps-quorum/blob/master/.gitconsensus.yaml)
  and pass all tests will be merged using
  [gitconsensus](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gitconsensus).

* Any code that gets merged into master will automatically be uploaded to the
  Screeps main world under the user
  [Quorum](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Quorum). Code is also deployed
  automatically once a day.

* If the [Quorum](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Quorum) user is no longer
  spawned in the game it will be relaunched using the
  [ScreepsAutoSpawner](https://github.com/tedivm/ScreepsAutoSpawner). The
  AutoSpawner fork used by this project has its own
  [conensus rules](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/ScreepsAutoSpawner/blob/master/.gitconsensus.yaml)
  and is also automatically kept up to date.

* All of the Quorum data is public using
  [ScreepsDashboard](https://github.com/tedivm/ScreepsDashboard) and hosted at
  [quorum.tedivm.com](http://quorum.tedivm.com/). This includes full console
  output, all memory and segment data, and wallet history (with more feature
  being developed as needed).

## Contributing

This project does everything but code itself- that part comes from community
pull requests.

The [developer wiki](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/screeps-quorum/wiki)
should be the first stop before diving into the code. Like the project itself
this is completely community run, and documentation contributions are always
appreciated.

Not sure where to get started? The github project has a
[list of needed features](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/screeps-quorum/issues)
specifically to give people a jumping off point for getting into the project.

Please take a moment to read the
[contributors guide](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/screeps-quorum/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to get an understanding of how the project works and how contributions will be
looked at by the community.

## Deploying

This codebase uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to deploy to the screeps server.
It uses a configuration file, `.screeps.json`, which can save multiple
configurations.

```json
{
  "main": {
    "username": "Quorum",
    "password": "random123",
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "127.0.0.1": {
    "username": "Quorum",
    "password": "random123"
  },
  "myserver.example.com": {
    "username": "Quorum",
    "password": "random123",
    "secure": true
  }
}
```

By default `Gulp` will deploy to the `main` server, but this can be changed with
the `server` flag.

```
gulp --server=127.0.0.1
```

By default gulp will push to the `default` branch. This can be changed in the
configuration file or by passing the `branch` option to gulp.
