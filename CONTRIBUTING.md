# Contributing to Screeps Quorum

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

## How Can I Contribute?

### Documentation

The [developer wiki](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/screeps-quorum/wiki) is
completely community run, and documentation contributions are always
appreciated.

### Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Enhancements

Bug Reports and Feature Requests are extremely important to a project like this.
As it is completely volunteer run, with no leaders, it's important to give
people projects they can use to jump right into the code base. When submitting a
new issue please take care to -

* Prefix the title of feature requests with `[feature]` and bug reports with
  `[bug]`. This will ensure the automated system labels them appropriately.
  Issues that do not start with one of these prefixes may get automatically
  closed.
* make sure it isn't a duplicate, and if you do find an existing ticket please
  add more detail to that ticket,
* add as much detail as is needed to either replicate the issue or fully build
  out the new feature.

### Planning Things Out

This is an extremely collaborative project. The larger a feature is the more
potential it has for disruption. When planning large features it's important to
talk things out in the slack channel or open an Issue on Github to solicit
feedback.

### Pull Requests

**Any pull request that gets accepted will be deployed to the screeps server
within moments of being merged.**

**Do not submit pull requests are are not ready to deploy.**

Please make sure you test all of your changes. This can be done with the in game
simulator, a private server, or one of the many public servers available. If you
need help please join us in slack for help.

Pull requests are accepted by votes, which depend on the
[conensus rules](https://github.com/ScreepsQuorum/ScreepsAutoSpawner/blob/master/.gitconsensus.yaml)
of the project. You are allowed to vote for your own pull requests.

This project follows the [prettier](https://prettier.io/) code style. This is
tested for by the Quorum continious integration system (currently CircleCI) and
any pull requests which do not follow this will not be merged regardless of
votes. It is recommended that you install the
[prettier plugin](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) for your editor so
you can take advantage of auto-format-on-save awesomeness.

### Third Party Services

When creating a pull request that provide integration with outside services
(continuous integration, code style checks, notifications, stats, etc) make a
separate issue description how to integrate with that service so a project
curator can provide the necessary infrastructure.
